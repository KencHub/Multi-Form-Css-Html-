## Overview

This is my first ever time to publish a web base source code here. It began when I had to play with CSS and HTML.
There are things I noted while playing with it and kind of made me understand many things i didn't know previously.
So, I don't have plans to update this yet to make it more responsive, interactive to the taste of many. My code here ain't clean to what you think, but it works for me.
What I happened to do with the responsiveness was to use media queries. "The media queries was also played"
Other of my work, projects uploaded thereof will be perfect or exclusive than this...

Anyone is free to repo or edit it.
